## Viable Options

### BIZON Tech (bizon-tech.com) — US-based, ships worldwide

Pre-built multi-GPU AI workstations with optional liquid cooling.

**Relevant models:**

| Model | GPUs | CPU Platform | Starting Price (USD) |
|-------|------|-------------|---------------------|
| **G3000** | 2-4 GPUs | Intel Xeon W (8-60 cores) | $4,437 |
| **X5500 G2** | 2-4 GPUs | AMD Threadripper PRO 9000WX/7000WX | $5,990 |

**GPU add-on pricing (per GPU):**
- RTX 5090 (32 GB): +$4,500
- RTX 6000 Ada (48 GB): +$8,749

**Example:** G3000 + 2x RTX 5090 + 24-core Xeon W: ~$14,000-16,000 USD (~CHF 12,700-14,500 before Swiss import).

**Shipping to Switzerland:** FedEx/DHL/UPS (5-9 business days). Import duties + Swiss VAT (7.7%) + customs = ~8-12% additional cost. Warranty: 3-year standard; customer pays shipping both ways for international repairs.

**Assessment:** Good quality but the price premium + import duties pushes equivalent specs over budget. A BIZON G3000 with 2x RTX 5090 (64 GB VRAM) costs ~CHF 14,000-16,500 all-in — for comparison, a single RTX PRO 6000 DIY build with 96 GB VRAM costs ~CHF 9,500.

### BRESSNER Technology (shop.bressner.de) — German, ships to CH

German company specializing in GPU servers and HPC solutions.

- GPU servers in 1U-4U rack form factors, up to 10 GPU slots
- Support for RTX 5090, RTX 4090, Tesla, and professional GPUs

### RECT (rect.coreto-europe.com) — German, online configurator

German manufacturer in Friedberg (Hessen), since 2001. Has an online configurator for real-time pricing.

**Key model:**

| Model | Form Factor | GPUs | CPU | Starting Price (EUR) |
|-------|-------------|------|-----|---------------------|
| **WS-8829C** | 4U Tower | Up to 3x RTX PRO 6000 or 2x RTX 5090 | AMD TR PRO 9000WX (96 cores) | EUR 5,195 |

Also offers rack workstations (WS-8839C, RS-8639G2) with AMD EPYC 9005.

**Assessment:** The WS-8829C is the most interesting pre-built option — it supports up to 3x RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell on the latest Threadripper PRO 9000WX platform. A fully configured 2x RTX 5090 system would likely land around EUR 10,000-13,000 (~CHF 9,500-12,400). German manufacturer simplifies warranty for Swiss buyers.
